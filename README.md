# Course Links

## Overview
Course Links is an app for students to share links (articles, resources, etc.) with their classmates. This is the GitHub tutorial component of my Sheridan IMM Tech Studio Project.

## Process
The content management system built in [Lynda.com PHP and MySQL Essential Training course](https://www.lynda.com/MySQL-tutorials/PHP-MySQL-Essential-Training/119003-2.html) was used as the foundation for this app.
